Classification approach can be used for situations where the available attributes change frequently or for attributes that are shared by a small range of products

They are both defined in *-items.xml. Yet, the type system approach is more efficient, while classification is not easily accessible through SAP Commerce API

Changes based on the type system approach require build, restart, and deployment

The performance cost is higher for the type system due to its greater usage of system resources, whereas the classification system involves little cost

You have defined two independent extensions. (1) extension1-beans.xml:(2) extension2-beans.xml: When you execute "ant all", what will happen?
